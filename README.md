Cryptully
=========

### Encrypted chat for those that don't know crypto.
##### Shane Tully (shane@shanetully.com)

### The default server, cryptully.com, has been taken down due to a lack of server to host it on. For the program to work, you will need to host your own server. If you are interested in providing hosting (only running a small Python script), contact me.

### Quick Start

1. Download the executable for your platform on the releases page.
2. Launch the executable (no need to install anything).
3. Select a nickname and connect to the server.
4. Enter the nickname of the person you want to chat with.
5. You should now be chatting!

Need more info? See the [documentation](https://cryptully.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for much more detailed instructions.

### Running From Source

Install the following:

* Python 2.7
* PyQt4
* M2Crypto
* Python Curses
* Clone the repo and run `python make.py run`.

Detailed instructions are on the [building page](https://cryptully.readthedocs.org/en/latest/building.html) of the documentation.

### Building
